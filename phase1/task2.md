# Task 2: Develop Three Use Cases
- Write three use case descriptions, one paragraph each:
  - **U1 (Main Use Case):** Data cleaning is necessary and sufficient.
  - **U0 (Zero Cleaning Use Case):** Dataset is already good enough.
  - **U2 (Never Enough Use Case):** No amount of cleaning will make the data suitable.
- For U1, define 1–3 sample queries (or analysis goals) that demonstrate why cleaning is needed.
- Clearly justify why D does or doesn’t support each use case without cleaning.
